Key Concepts: Deadlock, starvation, synchronization, std::mutex, std::condition_variable.

Advanced Projects
Concurrent Chat Application (Client-Server Model)


Objective: Create a multi-threaded client-server application where multiple clients can send and receive messages concurrently.

Key Concepts: Networking, std::thread, synchronization, client-server architecture, sockets.
Multi-threaded Task Scheduler


Objective: Implement a task scheduler that can run multiple tasks concurrently at scheduled times.
Details: Create a scheduler that accepts tasks (functions) and runs them at specified times or intervals. Use multiple threads to execute tasks concurrently.
Key Concepts: std::thread, task scheduling, synchronization, std::chrono.
Web Server (Handling Multiple Requests Concurrently)


Objective: Build a basic web server that can handle multiple HTTP requests concurrently.
Details: Use std::thread or a thread pool to handle incoming client requests in parallel. Parse HTTP requests and send back appropriate responses.
Key Concepts: Networking, multi-threading, socket programming, std::thread.
Parallel Sorting Algorithms (Multi-threaded)


Objective: Implement a parallel version of sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort.
Details: Use multiple threads to recursively divide the array and sort each partition concurrently, then merge the results.
Key Concepts: Divide and conquer, parallel algorithms, thread synchronization.
Parallel MapReduce Implementation


Objective: Implement a simple version of the MapReduce framework to process large datasets using multiple threads.
Details: The "Map" function processes input data in parallel, and the "Reduce" function merges the results. Implement thread management and synchronization to ensure correctness.
Key Concepts: MapReduce, parallelism, thread synchronization, std::thread.
Concurrent File Compression (e.g., ZIP)


Objective: Implement a basic multi-threaded file compression tool (like ZIP) where files are compressed in parallel.
Details: Split a large file into chunks and compress each chunk concurrently using multiple threads, then combine the compressed chunks into the final archive.
Key Concepts: File I/O, parallel processing, compression algorithms, std::thread, synchronization.
Real-time Stock Price Monitor (Multi-threaded)


Objective: Build a multi-threaded application that fetches and displays real-time stock prices.
Details: Use multiple threads to fetch stock data from different APIs concurrently. Each thread will update the stock price every time a new price is fetched, while ensuring thread safety.
Key Concepts: APIs, multithreading, real-time data, synchronization.
Multi-threaded Game Engine (Basic)


Objective: Implement a simple game engine where various parts of the engine (e.g., physics, rendering, input handling) run concurrently in separate threads.
Details: Split the game logic into different tasks that can be handled concurrently (like rendering graphics, physics simulation, audio playback). Use synchronization mechanisms to ensure correct operation.
Key Concepts: Game engines, multithreading, std::thread, real-time processing.

Key Concepts to Focus On While Implementing These Projects:
Thread Creation and Management: Use std::thread to create and manage threads.
Synchronization: Use std::mutex, std::lock_guard, std::unique_lock, and std::condition_variable to prevent race conditions and ensure proper synchronization.
Thread Pools: For efficiency, implement a thread pool to manage multiple threads without creating and destroying threads for each task.
Deadlock and Starvation: Be aware of potential issues like deadlock and starvation when multiple threads are competing for shared resources.
Shared Data Management: Use thread-safe structures (like std::atomic) or protect shared data using mutexes to avoid concurrent access issues.
